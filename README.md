# Introduction to GWOSC Data

This repository contains tutorials for the [GWOSC](https://gwosc.org) data.
The tutorials come as Jupyter Notebooks and use the Python language.
Don't hesitate to extract part of the notebooks in your own scripts.

Each notebook illustrates a particular aspect of working with GWOSC data:
  - Notebook 1 explains how to download data from the GWOSC website.
  - Notebook 2 presents details about reading the content of a file.
  - Notebook 3 presents quality flags, an important concept when working with gravitational wave data.
  - Notebook 4 presents another important concept for gravitational wave data, the frequency domain.
  - Notebook 5 presents a higher-level interface that hides many details to provide an easier access to the data.

We suggest 2 learning paths:
  - if you want to understand the details about GWOSC files, simply run the tutorials in order
  - if you're comfortable with gravitational wave data and don't want to bother about the details, go directly to notebook 5
