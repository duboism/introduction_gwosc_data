    "  - Click the [Timeline icon](https://gwosc.org/timeline/show/O3b_16KHZ_R1/H1_DATA*L1_DATA*V1_DATA/1256655618/12708000/). You should see plots like this: ![timeline](./timeline.png)\n",

    "  - The label on the far left indicates which instrument is represented in the plot. In this example, H1 corresponds to the \"Hanford One\" detector.\n",
    "  - The curve shows if the detector was collecting data at this particular time: a vertical bar indicates that the detector collects data while the absence of a bar indicates that the detector was not collecting data.\n",
    "  - This data set spans the Second Part of the Third Observing Run (O3b) i.e. from 2019-11-01T15:00:00 UTC (GPS=1256655618) to 2020-03-27T17:00:00 UTC (GPS=1269363618).\n",
    "  - You can use your mouse to zoom and pan the graphs and download the figure as an image on your computer by clicking on the \"...\" icon in the top-right corner of the plot."
